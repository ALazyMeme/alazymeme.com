        <h2>Rough Bitrate Calculator</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>This rough calculator is based on the so called 'bit per pixel' or 'bpp' value that allows one calculate the bitrate based upon this value. Where at the <b>0.1 bpp</b> is the highest value to be used, as anything above will result in diminishing return and basically wasting bandwidth. <b>0.05 bpp</b>> should be considered the lowest value and rarely one should go below it for <b>gameplay</b>.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>For variety casting, one does generally not want to go below <b>0.07 bpp</b> as this takes a wide variety of games into account that a variety caster can play and contains possible high motion gameplay, flashy vfx, foliage, or high detailed footage. Lower motion games, like HeartStone and simple platformers, can have a lower value to still look good, and creative casters can even go lower. If you see a lot of artifacting (blocky video), especially on movement, it means you have too little bitrate for the encode to look clean and should increase the bitrate.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Therefore, for variety casters, <b>900p60 @ 6000kbps</b> is popular as this results in the <b>0.07 bpp</b> value. Where <b>1080p60 @ 6000kbps</b> results in a <b>0.048 bpp</b> value. Of course this could work depending on the game. So personal testing is also required and fine tune on the game you play, do not blindly take over settings from a random guide!</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>(width x height x framerate x bpp) / 1000 = bitrate in kbps</p>
